# Benford's Law
The idea behind this project is to test Benford's Law.  Not to test whether a certain dataset matches the law but rather how/why the law works.

My idea is that Benford's Law is only value on datasets that increment (that is, count upwards... like a utility bill).  Truly random events
don't increment and thus should not align with the law).

The first thing I plan on testing is taking something that does work with Benford's Law and "twist" the data by finding the maximum value
possible in the data set (like the height of the tallest tree in the dataset) and then decrement the other values from that number.  I propose
this "new" dataset will not match Benford's Law but rather the inverse (9 being the most common).

Here we go!
